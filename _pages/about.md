I am currently a DPhil student at the Department of Engineering Science, the University of Oxford, working with <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gunes/">Dr. Gunes Baydin</a> and <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/">Prof. Philip Torr</a> (Torr Vision Group) and <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/">Prof. Yarin Gal</a> (OATML). Before joining Oxford, I pursued my Master's degree at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. During that time, I worked as a research assistant at KAIST's <a href="https://www.mlai-kaist.com/" target="_blank">MLAI Group</a>, supervised by Prof. Sung Ju Hwang.

My research interests include Representation Learning, Domain Adaptation/Generalization, Robustness, Efficient Inference, Bayesian Deep Learning, Deep Bayesian Learning and Deep Generative Models.

My CV is available upon request. 

Also, I am always interested in internship and collaboration opportunities. Please reach out to me via email: tuan at robots dot ox dot ac dot uk
