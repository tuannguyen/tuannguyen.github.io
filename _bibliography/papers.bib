  abstract={Domain generalization refers to the problem where we aim to train a model on
data from a set of source domains so that the model can generalize to unseen target
domains. Naively training a model on the aggregate set of data (pooled from all
source domains) has been shown to perform suboptimally, since the information
learned by that model might be domain-specific and generalize imperfectly to target
domains. To tackle this problem, a predominant domain generalization approach
is to learn some domain-invariant information for the prediction task, aiming at
a good generalization across domains. In this paper, we propose a theoretically
grounded method to learn a domain-invariant representation by enforcing the
representation network to be invariant under all transformation functions among
domains. We next introduce the use of generative adversarial networks to learn such
domain transformations in a possible implementation of our method in practice.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several widely used datasets for
the domain generalization problem, on all of which we achieve competitive results
with state-of-the-art models.},

title={Clinical Risk Prediction with Temporal Probabilistic Asymmetric Multi-Task Learning}, 
volume={35}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17097}, 
abstract={Although recent multi-task learning methods have shown to be effective in improving the generalization of deep neural networks, they should be used with caution for safety-critical applications, such as clinical risk prediction. This is because even if they achieve improved task-average performance, they may still yield degraded performance on individual tasks, which may be critical (e.g., prediction of mortality risk). Existing asymmetric multi-task learning methods tackle this negative transfer problem by performing knowledge transfer from tasks with low loss to tasks with high loss. However, using loss as a measure of reliability is risky since low loss could result from overfitting. In the case of time-series prediction tasks, knowledge learned for one task (e.g., predicting the sepsis onset) at a specific timestep may be useful for learning another task (e.g., prediction of mortality) at a later timestep, but lack of loss at each timestep makes it difficult to measure the reliability at each timestep. To capture such dynamically changing asymmetric relationships between tasks in time-series data, we propose a novel temporal asymmetric multi-task learning model that performs knowledge transfer from certain tasks/timesteps to relevant uncertain tasks, based on the feature-level uncertainty. We validate our model on multiple clinical risk prediction tasks against various deep learning models for time-series prediction, which our model significantly outperforms without any sign of negative transfer. Further qualitative analysis of learned knowledge graphs by clinicians shows that they are helpful in analyzing the predictions of the model.},
